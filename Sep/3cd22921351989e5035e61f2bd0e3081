San Juan Bautista, San Juan Bautista 15th mission 1797 Explore all of California’s 21 famed missions >> This mission, operated by the Catholic Church, is at the heart of the sleepy town of San Juan Bautista (population 1,862) and faces a broad, grassy plaza, part of San Juan Bautista State Historic Park. This is the widest California mission church interior, with three aisles. It has a history of ambitious music programs, and its museum collection includes instruments and two hand-written choir books from the mission’s early years. The altar screen dates to 1818. Also, notice the cat door carved into the blue side door of the Guadalupe Chapel. Mice could be a big problem in the 19th century, and the Franciscans counted on cats to catch them. In the cemetery, look for a red cross. It marks the resting place of Ascencion Solorsano (sometimes spelled Solorzano de Cervantes), “the last pure-blooded Native American of this mission,” who died in 1930. The mission also was a location for Alfred Hitchcock’s 1958 film “Vertigo.” Nearby: The state historic park (bit.ly/1teZFs5) includes many 19th century buildings, including the Plaza Hotel, Plaza Stables, Zanetta House/Plaza Hall and the Castro-Breen Adobe. A few steps downhill, you’ll find several pleasant Mexican restaurants along 2nd and 3rd streets. Info: 406 2nd St., San Juan Bautista; (831) 623-4528, bit.ly/1BLwiSk. Driving distance from Los Angeles City Hall: 311 miles northwest. From the archives:  In 1957, The Times wrote about Mission San Juan Bautista’s Father Arroyo de la Cuesta who learned 13 Native American dialects. In 2011, The Times reported on solstice sunbeams illuminating the altar at the San Juan Bautista mission. Interested in the stories shaping California?
