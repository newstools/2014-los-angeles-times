Visitors can walk in Godzilla’s footsteps, and live to tell about it, during a movie set tour on Oahu. The owners of Kualoa Ranch are sworn to secrecy and can’t divulge details until after “Godzilla” opens May 16, but it is known that at least one scene was filmed on a set built at the ranch’s Secret Island. It is one of the stops on a tour of the lush valley that guides refer to as “the backlot of Hawaii.” Godzilla has been stomping around the move business for six decades. The Japanese monster appeared in 1954 and has done 28 movies under his belt. This time around, he is, according to the movie website, “pitted against malevolent creatures who, bolstered by humanity’s scientific arrogance, threaten our very existence.” Early buzz is positive. For a tour of film spots, guests can board an old school bus that’s been painted dark green. They will be taken to the locations where scenes from movies, including “Jurassic Park” and “Windtalkers,” have been filmed. The ranch has also hosted crews shooting popular TV shows such as “Hawaii Five-0” and “Lost.” Tickets cost $27 for adults and $16 for children ages 3-12. Kualoa Ranch is along the scenic Kamehameha Highway on the eastern side of Oahu. It’s about a 45-minute drive from Honolulu. Info: Kualoa Ranch, (808) 237-7321.
